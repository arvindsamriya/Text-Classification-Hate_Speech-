# Text-Classification-Hate_Speech-
The objective of this project is to detect the racist and sexist comments from amazon reviews or does a review contain any hate speech in it,we will classify these reviews. We will use a Training sample to build a model and use that model on a test dataset to predict the labels on that dataset and find the accuracy of our model.
## Importance
This project is a part of Natural Language Processing(NLP) and the most important step of this project is feature extraction and Model Selection that we would see in the provided jupyter notebook
and learn how to remove words which don't make any difference in classifying the comment or review and usage of various python libraries which are generally used to make ML models.
## Where to Improve 
We got a accuracy of more than 80% in all the ML models that we have used but we can still improve in feature extraction to get better features which can more accurately clasify the comments.
